[Brief:SOV01]
Value=It is your good fortune to be in the vanguard of the Soviet assault on the United States. Lead your troops through Washington and destroy the most hated symbol of American military power, the Pentagon. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Destroy the Pentagon.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:SOV02]
Value=The Americans have foolishly gathered a fleet in a small harbor on the eastern coast of Florida. Assisted by General Vladimir in his Dreadnought, you will force a landing on the hostile shore and set up a base. When ready, you will strike out against the capitalist pigs and crush them under the iron heel of Soviet justice. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Force a landing and set up a base. 
ValueLine4= 
ValueLine5= Objective 2: Destroy all enemy forces.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:SOV03]
Value=In order to complete our psychic beacon, we will need to capture some American technology. Lead your forces into New York and capture their Battle Lab. Then build a Psychic Beacon to take control of the city. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Capture the American Battle Lab. 
ValueLine4= 
ValueLine5= Objective 2: Build and defend a Psychic Beacon.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:SOV04]
Value=The foolish Koreans have decided to take sides with the failing Allies. Their cowardly attempt to invade our Eastern territories will surely fail. Defend the motherland and, when you are ready, push the Koreans back into the ocean. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Establish a base. Defend the homeland. 
ValueLine4= 
ValueLine5= Objective 2: Destroy all enemy forces.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:SOV05]
Value=The European nations are planning to join with the crippled Americans. We must not let this act of aggresion go unpunished. You will lay waste to their beautiful Paris. We will show the Allies the true meaning of power by turning their own precious monuments into weapons of mass destruction. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Energize the PARIS TOWER with 3 TESLA TROOPERS. 
ValueLine4= Objective 2: Defend the PARIS TOWER from Allied attack. 
ValueLine5= Objective 3: Defeat all remaining Allied troops.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:SOV06]
Value=The Americans are on their knees, begging for mercy. The last remnants of their fleet at Pearl Harbor waits helplessly for your relentless attack. However, we have news that the Koreans are not yet beaten and may attempt to join up with the American Navy. They must not succeed. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Establish a base in the Hawaiian Islands. 
ValueLine4= 
ValueLine5= Objective 2: Destroy the Allied Navy.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:SOV07]
Value=The Americans have engaged their Chronosphere; a device that allows them to move soldiers across great distances almost instantly. They can now strike anywhere they wish. You must defend our Battle Lab in the Ural mountains. The Americans will surely strike there soon in a desperate but doomed attempt to shut down our development of the ultimate battle tank. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Defend your Battle Lab at all costs.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:SOV08]
Value=Even in the hour of our greatest victory, General Vladimir has turned against us. Tempted by the soft American lifestyle, he has gone rogue and convinced many loyal communists to turn against us. You must go to Washington DC and dig Vladimir out of his wretched hole. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Capture the White House.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:SOV09]
Value=Our victory is near at hand. The President has successfully eluded us, but we have tracked him to a dirty little fort called 'The Alamo' in San Antonio, Texas. You must use our Psi-Corp Troopers to mind control the President and force him to surrender the United States. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Use Mind-Control to capture the President.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:SOV10]
Value=In their final desperate hours, the Allies have managed to produce one last bit of super-technology. They have a Weather Control Device which they can use to create terrible storms that can sink fleets and level cities. We believe they have hidden their doomsday weapon in the isolated US Virgin Islands. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Capture the American Battle Lab to locate the Weather Control Device. 
ValueLine4= 
ValueLine5= Objective 2: Destroy the Weather Control Device.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:SOV11]

ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Destroy Yuri's headquarters - The Kremlin.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:SOV12]
Value=We have found the last feeble Allied stronghold. Their Chronosphere, now fully operational, can move soldiers anywhere in the world. They can strike at us in New York, in Prague, even in Moscow. Yuri's files show the device is located near Point Hope, Alaska. You must take what few forces we have in the area and lead an attack, before the Allies make use of their cowardly technology. This is the final hour, commander. Glory awaits. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Destroy the Chronosphere.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:ALL01]
Value=The Soviets have invaded. They outnumber us ten to one. You must assist special agent Tanya in New York. We are marshaling our forces as fast as we can, Commander, but we need time. A small American base, Fort Bradley, is in the New York area. If you can make contact, they may be able to assist in the defense of New York. Tanya will be moving through a chaotic battlefield. Keep your eye out for targets of opportunity and watch for new mission objectives. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Destroy the Soviet Dreadnought fleet. 
ValueLine4= 
ValueLine5= Objective 2: Make contact with Fort Bradley. 
ValueLine6= 
ValueLine7= Objective 3: Keep Tanya alive.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:ALL02]
Value=Soviet troops cover America like a foul plague. They have even penetrated our heartland to capture the Air Force Academy in Colorado. The Academy, its cadets, and the unique technology it contains are vital to our defense. Use Tanya to contact any American forces in the area, reclaim our Air Force Academy, and drive the Soviets from the area. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Capture the Soviet-occupied Air Force Academy Chapel. 
ValueLine4= 
ValueLine5= Objective 2: Destroy all Soviet forces. 
ValueLine6= 
ValueLine7= Objective 3: Keep Tanya alive.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Destroy the Psychic Beacon.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:ALL04]

ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Force a shore landing and establish a base. 
ValueLine4= 
ValueLine5= Objective 2: Destroy the Psychic Amplifier before it comes online.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:ALL05]
Value=European forces still refuse to fight with us, fearing a Soviet nuclear counterattack. We have discovered the location of their medium-range missiles in Poland. Special agent Tanya has secretly crossed the Polish border. You will direct her to destroy the Soviet Nuclear Missiles. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Infiltrate the Soviet Battle Lab. 
ValueLine4= 
ValueLine5= Objective 2: Neutralize the 2 Soviet Nuclear Missile Silos. 
ValueLine6= 
ValueLine7= Objective 3: Keep Tanya alive.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:ALL06]
Value=The Europeans have joined with us and the time has come to counterattack. We will retake Washington DC and then we will retake the rest of our nation from the Soviet scum. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Reinforce and assume command of Allied forces at the Pentagon. 
ValueLine4= 
ValueLine5= Objective 2: Destroy all Soviet forces in Washington.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:ALL07]
Value=The Soviets still cover most of the globe. We must continue to fight them wherever they may be. A Soviet fleet has been discovered en route to Hawaii. Destroy this fleet and the Pacific will be ours. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Destroy all Soviet forces.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:ALL08]
Value=Even as we cleanse America of Soviet forces, they continue to play with their psychic technology, desperately hoping that their little toys will destroy us. We have discovered a Psychic Beacon in St. Louis. Take special agent Tanya in and destroy the beacon. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Destroy the Soviet Psychic Beacon. 
ValueLine4= 
ValueLine5= Objective 2: Destroy all Soviet forces within St. Louis. 
ValueLine6= 
ValueLine7= Objective 3: Don't get Tanya killed.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:ALL09]
Value=The Soviets captured one of our west coast bases and with it one of our Prism Towers. We believe they may be trying to replicate that technology at a secret Soviet research facility in the Yucatan. A SEAL strike team is standing by, Commander, awaiting your orders. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Capture or Destroy any Soviet attempts to replicate our Prism Technology. 
ValueLine4= 
ValueLine5= Objective 2: Eradicate the Soviet base defending their research site.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:ALL10]
Value=Desperate for some success, Soviet forces have counterattacked our European allies in Germany, moving deep into the Black Forest. No doubt their commanders hope that they will find and capture Einstein's laboratory. Your special talents have been asked for. The Germans fear they will be defeated without your strategic skills. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Ensure the safety of Professor Einstein's laboratory. 
ValueLine4= 
ValueLine5= Objective 2: Destroy all Soviet forces.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:ALL11]
Value=Einstein has found the perfect place for his Chronosphere. Unfortunately this location is very close to Soviet-controlled Cuba. Build the Chronosphere and clear the area of Soviet nuclear missiles. We are nearly ready for our final attack on Moscow. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Build a Chronosphere. 
ValueLine4= 
ValueLine5= Objective 2: Neutralize the Soviet Nuclear threat on Cuba.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:ALL12]
Value=The war is nearly at an end. A hand-picked group of volunteers will use the Chronosphere to invade Moscow from across the world. Once you have secured the Kremlin, Tanya will capture Romanov and put an end to Soviet aggression. You are the only commander skilled enough to make this work. Your forces will be outnumbered at least ten to one. Good luck. 
ValueLine2= 
ValueLine3= Objective 1: Clear the area so Chrono Reinforcements can arrive. 
ValueLine4= 
ValueLine5= Objective 2: Eliminate Romanov's Elite Black Guard around the Kremlin.
WhiteSpaceWarning=WARNING: This label value contains leading or trailing whitespace characters in one or more lines.

[Brief:TRN01]

[VOX:cevau01]
Value=Like our own Construction Vehicle, the Soviets can use this MCV to place base anywhere.

[VOX:cevau02]
Value=The Soviet War Miner can easily hold off a small attack force. When hunting down the War Miner, send plenty of fire-power.

[VOX:cevau03]
Value=Simple Soviet technology. The Rhino Heavy Tank is slow, heavily armored and fitted with a devestating short range cannon.

[VOX:cevau04]
Value=The Soviet Terror Drone can easily penetrate the armor of our vehicles. Once inside a vehicle the Terror Drone will destroy it slowly from within. The only way to get a Terror Drone out of a vehicle is to move it to a Service Depot.

[VOX:cevau05]
Value=The Flak Track is standard Soviet air defense. Like all Soviet technology, it is slow and well armored.

[VOX:cevau06]
Value=The V3 is a powerful long-range artillery weapon. Beware commander, it can level your base in minutes without you ever getting a chance to even return fire.

[VOX:cevau07]
Value=The most powerful Soviet Tank ever built, the Apocalpyse is a small army all by itself and is equipped to handle both ground and air threats.

[VOX:cevau08]
Value=The most powerful air unit ever created, the Kirov can take a beating and drop an almost unlimitted number of heavy iron bombs.

[VOX:cevau09]
Value=The Sea Scorpion makes an excellent raider and can also be used to escort heavy Soviet warships.

[VOX:cevau10]
Value=The Soviets have somehow managed to pacify and control the Giant Squid found in the cold waters of the North Pacific. Beware commander, they can immobilize a ship and pull it under in a matter of minutes.

[VOX:cevau11]
Value=The Soviets use their Typhoon Attack Sub to raid our shipping and make surprise attacks on our fleets.

[VOX:cevau12]
Value=The Armored Transort is meant to carry a large number of troops across an ocean to our shores. It is often filled with Soviet troops and can be difficult to destroy.

[VOX:cevau13]
Value=The ultimate in Soviet long-range bombardment, the Dreadnought is powerful from a distance but can be easily destroyed at close range. The Dreadnought's missiles can also be shot down by patriot missiles.

[VOX:cevau14]
Value=The standard Soviet grunt, the Consript is poorly fed, poorly trained and poorly equipped for combat with your boys.

[VOX:cevau15]
Value=The Soviets have taken Tesla Technology to the final step, a man in a Tesla powered suit. These soldiers are excellent at destroying tanks and also seem to be able to power up Tesla Coils with their extra energy.

[VOX:cevau16]
Value=The Soviet Engineer is effective though he is more poorly trained than his American counter-part.

[VOX:cevau17]
Value=Beware these Soviet Attack Dogs, they can quickly sniff out our spies and ruin all of our attempts at covert operations.

[VOX:cevau18]
Value=This Soviet lunatic can and will place bombs on just about anything.

[VOX:cevau19]
Value=This soldier is equiped with a nuclear battlesuit. He can irradiate large patches of ground, making them impassible to infantry or light vehicles.

[VOX:cevau20]
Value=The Soviets have been experimenting with Psychic technology with some success. Their elite PsiCorps can cause our own loyal soldiers to turn against us.

[VOX:cevau21]
Value=Sir, our GI is the finest example of standard infantry soldier in the world. Whether deployed or garrisoning a city building, the GI's heavy machine gun can quickly neutralize any enemy infantry threat.

[VOX:cevau22]
Value=This, sir, is our IFV. It is a multipurpose raider capable of boosting the standard weapon capabilities of any infantryman inside.

[VOX:cevau23]
Value=Sir, this is an engineer. He can repair any Allied building and once inside an enemy building turn it to our side. He is much smarter than his Soviet counterpart.

[VOX:cevau24]
Value=Sir, the SEAL is the elite soldier. No enemy is safe from him, whether on land or water.

[VOX:cevau25]
Value=Commander, the spy's ability to mask himself as the enemy and pass through their ranks gives him the needed edge to infiltrate even the most well guarded enemy building. If only they didn't taste so good to their dogs_

[VOX:cevau26]
Value=The Rocketeers are the brave men who strap maneuvering thrusters to their backs and then go out to hunt enemy tanks and air forces. They are very brave.

[VOX:cevau27]
Value=Commander, this is a Chrono Legionnaire. Using Professor Einstein's Chronal technology they teleport next to any enemy and utterly erase them from time.

[VOX:cevau28]
Value=Sir, these superbly trained dolphins are equipped with special array that allows them to concentrate their natural sonar to easily locate enemy submerged vessels or further concentrate their sonar to attack.

[VOX:cevau29]
Value=Although not as well armored as its Soviet counterpart, our Grizzly Battle tank is much faster and packs the same punch.

[VOX:cevau30]
Value=Commander, our Prism Tank is based on the Prof. Einstein's light enhancement process. It is most effective in dealing with the massive force tactics that the Soviets prefer to use.

[VOX:cevau31]
Value=Commander, our Mirage Tank's ability to hide itself among any natural objects around it make it the perfect ambush or covert surveillance vehicle.

[VOX:cevau32]
Value=The Black Hawk helicopter utilizes the most advanced stealth technologies slip past enemy lines without detection on radar.

[VOX:cevau33]
Value=Sir, the Intruder is a VTOL attack aircraft capable of delivery its ordinance on any target package you desire across the combat zone.

[VOX:cevau34]
Value=Another marvel of technology from Professor Einstein's bag of tricks. Our Chrono Miners can teleport safely and quickly straight back home after gathering their ore supply.

[VOX:cevau35]
Value=Commander, our landing craft is capable of quickly ferrying troops and armor across any body of water- wherever you need them- whenever you need them.

[VOX:cevau36]
Value=Commander, our Destroyer is the workhorse of the navy. No naval unit can long hide from it and once detected, it makes short work of the enemy.

[VOX:cevau37]
Value=Commander, there is no airborne threat that can evade the sight or missile of the Aegis Cruiser. It is the premier anti-air weapon.

[VOX:cevau38]
Value=Sir, our Aircraft Carriers are the pride of the Allied navy. In a moments notice, the carrier's planes can take out any target quickly and from a very safe distance.

[VOX:csof151]
Value=Weather Control Device temporarily unavailable.

[VOX:csofu01]
Value=The Soviet Construction Vehicle is essential and should be defended as such. You cannot create a Construction Yard without one.

[VOX:csofu02]
Value=The Allied Chrono Miner may have the greater speed of teleportation but our War Miner is heavily armored and heavily armed making it immune to most harassment attacks.

[VOX:csofu03]
Value=As the backbone of the Soviet assault force, the Rhino Heavy Tank should be used in all forward positions.

[VOX:csofu04]
Value=Soviet technology at its finest. Terror Drones can enter and destroy enemy vehicles from the inside.

[VOX:csofu05]
Value=The Flak Track is an effective anti-air defense unit, but its flak burst just as effective against ground targets if you don't mind the mess.

[VOX:csofu06]
Value=The V3 Launcher has extreme range capabilities coupled with devastating damage potential. Destruction guaranteed just don't leave it undefended.

[VOX:csofu07]
Value=The appropriately named Apocalypse Tank is war in a can. It can attack any ground or air targets and be expected to be the last unit standing.

[VOX:csofu08]
Value=They may be slow, but the Kirov Airships can take great punishment and deliver even more.

[VOX:csofu09]
Value=The Sea Scorpion is a fast-attack sea raider. It can't win the war for you but you can't win the war without it. It is your only anti-air defense on the water.

[VOX:csofu10]
Value=I don't agree with this kind of experimentation, but you cannot deny the results. A Giant Squid can immobilize and eventually destroy any sea vessel.

[VOX:csofu11]
Value=The Typhoon Attack Sub is undetectable by normal Allied units, but look out for Allied Dolphins and Destroyers.

[VOX:csofu12]
Value=Unlike the Allied naval transport, our Armored Transport is well armed. It will get your men and units to the target.

[VOX:csofu13]
Value=The Soviet Dreadnought can launch destructive missiles over great distances, but its fire rate is too slow for direct combat.

[VOX:csofu14]
Value=Our Soviet Conscripts may not be as well trained as the Allied GI, but we have the advantage of greater numbers.

[VOX:csofu15]
Value=The Tesla Troopers have powerful weapons, but they are useless against buildings. They also make excellent base defense as they can over-power Tesla Coils with their weapons.

[VOX:csofu16]
Value=The Soviet Engineer can repair buildings or capture enemy buildings, if you can get them past defenses.

[VOX:csofu17]
Value=Soviet attack dogs can smell out enemy Spies and deal with them quickly. Don't leave them out of your base defense teams.

[VOX:csofu18]
Value=Crazy Ivan can plant bombs on enemy buildings or perhaps a Conscript would agree to carry them for you.

[VOX:csofu19]
Value=The Allies cannot match our nuclear power. Deploy the Desolator to sterilize an area.

[VOX:csofu20]
Value=Our most top-secret weapon, the PsiCorps is useful for quickly turning Allied units to our side.

[VOX:csofu21]
Value=Commander, this Allied GI is a well trained soldier capable of quickly deploying a heavy machine gun when stationed within buildings or deployed with his sandbag nest.

[VOX:csofu22]
Value=This_thing_is the allied IFV. Any soldier that climbs inside will find his primary weapon's capabilities boosted. As with most Allied vehicles it is very quick.

[VOX:csofu23]
Value=Although similar to our own engineers in their ability to repair damaged buildings and bridges or even to steal another's building, the Allied engineers are nowhere near as well trained as our own engineers.

[VOX:csofu24]
Value=Comrade, this SEAL is a threat to all of our forces. They must be watched for at all times, whether on land or even at sea.

[VOX:csofu25]
Value=These arrogant Allied Spies believe their disguises will allow them to infiltrate our buildings. They will soon find that the only thing they can infiltrate is our faithful dogs' stomachs.

[VOX:csofu26]
Value=The Allied Rocketeers are men who hurl themselves through the air thanks to some jet-pack strapped to them in the hopes of wounding one of our tanks or buildings. Fools.

[VOX:csofu27]
Value=Commander, beware these Chrono Legionnaires. They use some unknown technology to teleport themselves anywhere and then simply erase our forces.

[VOX:csofu28]
Value=These dolphin nuisances are quick. They can sense the passage of our submarines and find our Squids and their squeal can do some damage as well.

[VOX:csofu29]
Value=Commander, the Allied Grizzly Tank is a smaller, quicker version of our own tanks, but its armor is not sufficient to stand up directly to our own.

[VOX:csofu30]
Value=Comrade, this `Prism' Tank of the Allies is a dangerous threat to our massed forces. Its directed energy weapon has no trouble harming many of our forces in a single shot.

[VOX:csofu31]
Value=Another annoying trick of the Allies, their Mirage Tank can mask itself a nearly any object nearby it and then remain concealed and fire upon us.

[VOX:csofu32]
Value=Sir, the enemy's Black Hawk transport must always be watched for. It can not be seen by radar, so you must keep a watchful eye ready to stop it.

[VOX:csofu33]
Value=The Allied Intruder is an airborne threat to any of our forces who do not have adequate anti-air support. It does not stand up well to flak, Commander.

[VOX:csofu34]
Value=Yet another parlor trick from that nuisance Einstein. The Allied Chrono Miner gathers ore from the field and then teleports itself and its small yield back to its refinery.

[VOX:csofu35]
Value=Compared to our own Armored Transport, this small transport is unimpressive. It delivers a small number of forces across the water.

[VOX:csofu36]
Value=These Allied Destroyers are a problem. They can detect us underwater as well as on the surface and are equipped to deal sufficient damage to both.

[VOX:csofu37]
Value=Commander, this is the Allies Aegis Cruiser. If you do not try to attack it from the air, then it will quickly be underwater and harmless.

[VOX:csofu38]
Value=Commander, these Allied Aircraft Carriers are dangerous if left alone to bomb us from a distance but they are not very good for close combat against submerged combatants.

[VOX:csofu39]
Value=Comrade, Tanya is a threat to all of our forces. They must be watched for at all times, whether on land or even at sea.

[VOX:ma1ev02]
Value=Looks like the bridge has been blown. We'll have to find another way to Fort Bradley.

[VOX:ma1ev03]
Value=The Soviet Navy is attacking the Statue of Liberty! We can't let them get away with that! Sir, is there anything you can do?

[VOX:ma1ev04]
Value=Doesn't sound good, Sir! We're going to have to double-time it the rest the way to reach Fort Bradley in time!

[VOX:ma1ev05]
Value=Congratulations! We've reestablished contact with Fort Bradley! They're turning over control of the base and its troops to you.

[VOX:ma1ev06]
Value=We seem to have lost power, sir! Build more power plants.

[VOX:ma1ev07]
Value=Looks like the bridge has collapsed. We'll have to get our Engineers to repair it!

[VOX:ma1ev08]
Value=Watch out for those Petroleum barrels - They seem highly unstable! Perhaps we can use them to our advantage...

[VOX:ma1ev09]
Value=Our GI's are too exposed to enemy fire! Maybe they should take shelter in nearby buildings!

[VOX:ma1ev10]
Value=Sir, I'm sorry to report that we've lost Tanya_

[VOX:ma1ev11]
Value=There's the Supply Base! Destroy all of the buildings, and we'll buy some time for the rest of the country!

[VOX:ma1ev12]
Value=We've done it Sir! The Supply Base has been eliminated!

[VOX:ma1ev13]
Value=You must hurry to reach Fort Bradley as quickly as possible!

[VOX:ma1ev14]
Value=To earn more credits, command your Chrono Miners to gather ore.

[VOX:ma1ev15]
Value=This vehicle is known as a Chrono Miner - it can be used to gather valuable minerals, and when fully loaded will teleport back to the Refinery docking bay.

Value=Soviet paratroopers detected.

[VOX:ma1ev18]
Value=Commander, you must reach Fort Bradley as quick... wait... What are those Dreadnoughts doing? They're attacking the Statue of Liberty? You can't let this happen!

[VOX:ma1ev19]
Value=Liberty is fallen, sir. This looks like the beginning of the end.

[VOX:ma1ev20]
Value=Tanya has perished, sir. We can't do this without her!

[VOX:ma1ev21]
Value=Sir, Fort Bradley just reported that the Soviets have managed to establish a small supply base just southeast of here. If we can eliminate the supply base, perhaps can stall the invasion for a short while!

[VOX:ma1ev22]
Value=Deploy an occupied civilian structure to evacuate its occupants.

[VOX:ma2ta01]
Value=All right! This beacon's neutralized! Send in the cavalry

[VOX:ma3ev01]
Value=You have discovered Allied units abandoned after the Soviet invasion.

[VOX:ma3ev02]
Value=The Psychic Beacon must be destroyed, Commander!

[VOX:ma3ev03]
Value=Watch out for Soviet troops garrisoned in civilian structures throughout the city!

[VOX:ma4ev01]
Value=Objective 1: Use your paradrop squad to take out the Soviet Tesla Reactors, shutting down their harbor defenses.

[VOX:ma4ev02]
Value=Objective 2:

[VOX:ma4ev03]
Value=Seek out the Soviets' Tesla Reactors and take them out with your Destroyers, crippling their air defenses.

[VOX:ma4ev04]
Value=Perhaps we should send our Destroyers scouting up the Chicago River, they may reveal key installations in the Soviet base.

[VOX:ma5ev01]
Value=You can check one missile off your list, Sir! That bird will never fly again.

[VOX:ma5ev02]
Value=Sir, we managed to capture one of the Silos - instead of destroying it! Why don't we just turn it against the other missile Silo?

[VOX:ma5ev03]
Value=If you can get a Spy into one of those Tesla Generators, he can probably shut down all of the base's power for a good 30 seconds.

[VOX:ma5ev04]
Value=I'm resizing your radar to compensate for the Nuclear missile coordinates that we just received. Stand by.

[VOX:ma5ev05]
Value=Sir! You just blew up the Soviet Battlelab! Without the Missile Silo coordinates, we can't complete our mission!

[VOX:ma5ev06]
Value=Congratulations, Sir! With both nukes neutralized, the European Alliance can join the war! We may have just changed the course of history!

[VOX:ma5ev07]
Value=If you can get a Spy into one of those Tesla Generators, he can probably shut down all of the base's power for a good 60 seconds.

[VOX:ma5ev08]
Value=Sir, Tanya is missing in action. Without her, our efforts here are in vain.

[VOX:ma5i101]
Value=Thanks for rescuing us, Sir! Our plane was shot down by Soviet anti-aircraft. There's probably more survivors around here.

[VOX:ma5i201]
Value=Glad you found us, Sir! We're freezing out here!

[VOX:ma5i301]
Value=Good to see you, Sir! What are our orders?

[VOX:ma5i401]
Value=Be on the lookout for spies, Comrade. It seems a little quiet tonight.

[VOX:ma5i501]
Value=(Laugh) We don't need to worry about stupid American spies. That's what the dogs are for.

[VOX:ma5ta01]
Value=Looks like we're going to need some more Spies, Sir!

[VOX:ma5ta02]
Value=Sir, could you send some more Spies without neon camouflage this time?

[VOX:ma5ta03]
Value=Looks like Spies are becoming an Endangered Species. Send some more!

[VOX:ma5ta04]
Value=(Tanya swears several times and is 'beeped' out) Sorry, Sir, but we need some more Spies.

[VOX:ma6ev01]
Value=Hey! That's not Lincoln. They've put a Stalin head on him!

[VOX:ma6ev02]
Value=Sir, several of our vehicles have been eaten by Terror Drones. Our Service Depot can remove the drones and save our vehicles.

[VOX:ma7ev01]
Value=Commander, Niihau Island has fallen. We should prepare the rest of Hawaii for invasion.

[VOX:ma7ev02]
Value=Commander, the Soviets have finished construction of a nuclear missile launcher on Niihau. We must build Gap Generators to hide our base before they can launch.

[VOX:ma8ia01]
Value=Can't concentrate voices in my head_ _victory to the Soviet Union.

[VOX:ma8ia02]
Value=victory to the Sov we're free! Get'em!

[VOX:ma8ta01]
Value=Must reach the beacon just a little bit farther long live the glorious peoples Soviet state.

[VOX:ma9se01]
Value=We're going to need some help getting through those defenses.

[VOX:ma9se02]
Value=Hot Tamale! That's no Mayan Pyramid_ that's a Prism Cannon.

[VOX:ma9se03]
Value=Sir, these freedom fighters want to join up.

[VOX:maaei01]
Value=What does this button do?

[VOX:maaei02]
Value=Commander! Look out! They are over here.

[VOX:maaei03]
Value=Get these commander! Here they are! Here!

[VOX:maaei04]
Value=You should see this Commander!

[VOX:maaev01]
Value=Please don't touch the auxiliary controls professor. They notify the commander of important events.

[VOX:maaev02]
Value=Professor please stay off this channel.

[VOX:maaev03]
Value=Professor Einstein! I'm sure the Commander sees that.

[VOX:maaev04]
Value=Professor if you touch the controls again_

[VOX:maaev05]
Value=Sir, if you build and deploy a spy satellite you will be able to see the entire combat area.

[VOX:maaev06]
Value=We're rather low on resources in this location, sir. Perhaps you should construct an Ore Purifier so we can get more out of what we have.

[VOX:mabev01]
Value=Commander, Marine World has loaned us their trained dolphins. They can be use a sonic enhancer to attack the Squids and drive them off our ships.

[VOX:macev12]
Value=Commander, the time to act is now. The bulk of our armies stand ready to be transported to this very location, but first Tanya must clear the way for them by eliminating the Psychic Amplifier.

[VOX:macev13]
Value=Tanya has failed, sir. Our best efforts have been all for naught.

[VOX:macev14]
Value=Sir, the Psychic Amplifier has been destroyed, and Soviet forces have begun to defect to our side!

[VOX:macev15]
Value=Our objective now is simple: Tanya must capture Romanov from his hiding place - the Kremlin.

[VOX:macev16]

[VOX:ms5so02]

[VOX:msaso03]

[VOX:msaso04]
Value=Ah-ha, there it is! A Weather Control Device. Luckily Intel says that it couldn't possibly be operational yet. Take it out, Commander.

[VOX:msaso05]
Value=Apparently our intelligence was wrong. Apologies, Commander. I'm now downloading schematics for a Nuclear Missile Silo so you can deal with this new threat.

[VOX:msayu01]
Value=Perhaps I could be of assistance.

[VOX:msbso01]
Value=Yuri will destroy us all. He must be stopped, no matter what the cost.

[VOX:msbso02]
Value=(commenting on Yuri's invulnerable Iron Curtained soldiers) Commander, Yuri must be using an Iron Curtain device to make his troops invulnerable to attack! Intel indicates that the Iron Curtain effect can't possibly be maintained for long.

[VOX:msbso05]
Value=Commander, looks like our Nuclear Silo has been noticed... Yuri's sending bunch of Kirovs our way!

[VOX:msbso06]
Value=We'd better get some Flak Cannons in place.

[VOX:msbyu01]
Value=You don't really think that War Factory will help you defeat me, do you?

[VOX:msbyu02]
Value=So you're building a Kirov I'm impressed.

[VOX:msbyu03]
Value=I wouldn't build that Psychic Sensor if I were you.

[VOX:msbyu04]
Value=You're not really planning to nuke mother Russia, are you?

[VOX:msbyu05]
Value=Terror Drones are such mindless beasts. Why don't you train an Engineer instead?

[VOX:mscso03]
Value=Now move up the coast. There is a small airfield there where we can build a base and reclaim our captured Kirov airships.

[VOX:mscso04]
Value=They are using the Chronosphere to transport troops into our base! We cannot stop this assault. Attack soon, Commander, or we will be overrun!

[VOX:mt1ds01]
Value=Good morning commander and welcome to basic training. There's a war on so we have to make this a crash course. In front of you is your battlefield control interface. With this interface you can command any soldier on the field. Let's begin with the new recruit you see in the center of your screen. Move him away from his barracks and out into the field. Left click on the soldier to select him. Then left click on empty ground to move him to that location. Try not to get him killed on the way to the shooting range.

[VOX:mt1ds02]
Value=Notice how you can order your soldier to move into the dark area surrounding the base. This shroud indicates areas of the terrain that you have not yet explored.

[VOX:mt1ds03]
Value=Now that you've mastered the difficult task (said sarcastically) of commanding a single soldier, try ordering around a squad. First, select all of the men by left clicking and holding down the mouse button. In this mode you can drag a selection box around all of your men. Select all of the soldiers at once and order them north to the bridge.

[VOX:mt1ds04]
Value=This bridge was destroyed yesterday when the Navy SEALs used it for demolition practice. An engineer is en-route to repair it. When he arrives, left click on him to select him then left click on the repair hut next to the bridge. Once the bridge is repaired, move your men across.

[VOX:mt1ds05]
Value=This is the shooting range. Select your men by drag-selecting a box around the group. Once selected, left click on the targets down range. This will order your men to fire at these targets. Destroy all of the targets.

[VOX:mt1ds06]
Value=Excellent, your men are good shots. There is a row of targets just out of range of your GIs. Double click on one of your men. He will set himself up in a small defensive position. In this mode he can fire at a greater range. Many units have special abilities like this. Now, order him to destroy the remaining targets.

[VOX:mt1ds07]
Value=Notice that one of your men has a special symbol on him when he is selected. This unit is a veteran unit. Veterans are tougher, stronger and can fire more accurately than ordinary soldiers. Double click on the man who is set up in a defense position to order him to move-out. Now order your men to move on down the road.

[VOX:mt1ds08]
Value=In front of you is a derelict American Grizzly Battle Tank. Order your men to destroy the crippled tank.

[VOX:mt1ds09]
Value=It takes your men longer to destroy the tank than the targets at the rifle range. Regular soldiers are not efficient at destroying armored units. In turn, armored units may not be the most effective weapons for destroying dug in infantry. Pick the right unit when facing enemies. Good job today, you have completed an important part of your training.

[VOX:mt1ds10]
Value=Hurry up commander, you're boring me.

[VOX:mt1ds11]
Value=Keep it moving commander, your training has to go quickly, the Reds are already landing on our shores.

[VOX:mt1ds12]
Value=Commander, this is only one soldier. In a few days you will have to command armies. Now left click on him and then left click on open ground to get him moving out of the base.

[VOX:mt2ds01]
Value=Today you will fight a mock battle against another commander. He will command the red team, you will command of the blue team. Select your Mobil Construction Vehicle by left clicking on it and order it to move out of the base. Get it a safe distance away and try to find some open ground.

[VOX:mt2ds02]
Value=Your Mobile Construction Vehicle is now in open ground. Double click on it to deploy a Construction Yard.

[VOX:mt2ds03]
Value=Now that you have a Construction Yard you can begin to build a base. On the right hand side of your screen you can see that the icon for a Power Plant has appeared. Left click on that icon to start construction of the power plant. Notice how your remaining money decreases while the Power Plant is building. Each building has a cost to construct. When the Power Plant is done building, left click on it's image and then left click on an empty area near your Construction Yard. If you see red squares where you are trying to place the power plant then you are either trying to place the Power Plant too far away from your Construction Yard or you are trying to build on uneven ground.

[VOX:mt2ds04]
Value=Good, your base now has power and you are ready to build more structures. Each buiding you construct also has a power cost. If you run short of power for all of your buildings, some will stop working, and others will work inefficiently. Left click on the Ore Refinery Icon on the right hand side of your screen to build a refinery.

[VOX:mt2ds05]
Value=Now that you have placed a Power Plant you can build a barracks. Many buildings and units depend on one another. You cannot build a barracks until you have built a Power Plant. You cannot train soldiers until you have a barracks. Left click on the barracks to start its construction. When it is finished place it on the terrain just like you did with the Refinery and Power Plant.

[VOX:mt2ds06]
Value=On the right hand side of your screen you should see a button that looks like a soldier. When you press that button you will see the different types of soldiers that you can train. Right now all you can train is a GI. Left click on the GI to start training him. Left click multiple times to train a series of GIs.

[VOX:mt2ds07]
Value=Red team may attack soon. Your GIs are armed with rubber bullets for this mission. In real combat they would of course be shooting real bullets.

[VOX:mt2ds08]
Value=Here comes red team, make me proud commander.

[VOX:mt2ds09]
Value=Red team's strike force has been defeated. Now build some more soldiers commander and when you feel you are ready, move them out onto the map. Find Red team's Command Center and destroy it.

[VOX:mt2ds10]
Value=You really weren't ready for red team were you commander? If this had happened against the Soviets, your base would now be in flames. Red team will pull back to give you a chance to build some more troops.

[VOX:mt2ds11]
Value=Good job commander, you have defeated the red team. Your basic training complete.

[VOX:mt2ds12]
Value=Your new Chrono Miner will automatically begin to collect ore.

[VOX:mt2ds13]
Value=WARNING: The Red Team invasion imminent.

[VOX:mt2ds14]
Value=Deploy your GIs near the entrance to your base for a better defense.

[VOX:mt2ds15]
Value=Send your troops to garrison inside the barn for better protection from enemy fire.

[VOX:mt2ds16]
Value=Send your troops to garrison inside civilian structures for better protection from enemy fire.

[VOX:mt2ds17]
Value=Now is not the time for potty breaks, Commander.

[VOX:mt2ds18]
Value=No time to sit, Commander.

[VOX:mt2ds19]
Value=WARNING: The stench of Red Team is in the air.

[VOX:mt2ds20]
Value=Now that you'e mastered the difficult task (said sarcastically) of commanding a single soldier, try ordering around a squad. First, select all of the men by left clicking and holding down the mouse button. In this mode you can drag a selection box around all of your men. Select all of the soldiers at once and order them East to the bridge.

[VOX:mt2ds21]
Value=Notice that one of your men has a special symbol on him when he is selected. This unit is a veteran unit. Veterans are tougher, stronger and can fire more accurately than ordinary soldiers. Double click on the man who is set up in a defense position to order him to move-out. Now order your men to move on up the road.

[VOX:tauam01]
Value=Gosh darn it, I need more cash!

[VOX:tauam02]
Value=Yippy-kai-aye, I'm going in!

[VOX:tauam03]
Value=Anytime you want to get into the fight, just jump on in.

[VOX:tauam04]
Value=Try to distract him, I've got a plan.

[VOX:tauam05]
Value=If you give up now, I promise amnesty for you and your men.

[VOX:tauam06]
Value=Hahahaha.

[VOX:tauam07]
Value=That was a cowards tactic.

[VOX:tauam08]
Value=It's too late to surrender now.

[VOX:taubr01]
Value=I am running a little low of cash.

[VOX:taubr02]
Value=Attention, I am about to attack.

[VOX:taubr03]
Value=Your help would be greatly appreciated.

[VOX:taubr04]
Value=Try to get the enemies attention, me and the lads are going to try something.

[VOX:taubr05]
Value=Perhaps you should surrender, and avoid further bloodshed.

[VOX:taubr06]
Value=Hahahaha.

[VOX:taubr07]
Value=That was hardly fair, now was it?

[VOX:taubr08]
Value=Heads up old boy, here I come.

[VOX:taucu01]
Value=How can I fight without money?

[VOX:taucu02]
Value=I attack, now!

[VOX:taucu03]
Value=Help me you fool.

[VOX:taucu04]
Value=If you would do something, I might do something.

[VOX:taucu05]
Value=Surrender!

[VOX:taucu06]
Value=Hahahaha.

[VOX:taucu07]
Value=You cheap, sniveling little coward!

[VOX:taucu08]
Value=As if there was ever any doubt.

[VOX:taufr01]
Value=I have run out of money.

[VOX:taufr02]
Value=I think I may actually attack.

[VOX:taufr03]
Value=I'm getting slaughtered, I will have to surrender in moments.

[VOX:taufr04]
Value=Distract our enemy and I may try something.

[VOX:taufr05]
Value=Surrender! No, I don't mean I surrender. I mean you surrender.

[VOX:taufr06]
Value=Hahahaha.

[VOX:taufr07]
Value=Even a trained monkey could execute that maneuver.

[VOX:taufr08]
Value=Are you ready for me to crush you like the bug that you are?

[VOX:tauge01]
Value=I need money immediately.

[VOX:tauge02]
Value=The time to attack is now.

[VOX:tauge03]
Value=Send help or you will soon be on your own.

[VOX:tauge04]
Value=Distract him, I have something _clever_ in mind.

[VOX:tauge05]
Value=Surrender, you are all but beaten.

[VOX:tauge06]
Value=Hahahaha.

[VOX:tauge07]
Value=I will get you for that.

[VOX:tauge08]
Value=Ah, victory.

[VOX:tauir01]
Value=As unbelievable as it may seem, I am out of money.

[VOX:tauir02]
Value=I am about to attack.

[VOX:tauir03]
Value=You must send help, don't ask questions, just do as you are told.

[VOX:tauir04]
Value=If you distract our enemy, I will execute my master plan.

[VOX:tauir05]
Value=It will be very boring for me, but perhaps you should surrender.

[VOX:tauir06]
Value=Hahahaha.

[VOX:tauir07]
Value=I will make you pay for that.

[VOX:tauir08]
Value=Is not my army beautiful? Behold as it destroys everything you own.

[VOX:tauko01]
Value=My resources are exhausted.

[VOX:tauko02]
Value=My men are ready, soon we will attack.

[VOX:tauko03]
Value=My soldiers are being slaughtered, send help.

[VOX:tauko04]
Value=Distract our enemy commander and I will destroy him.

[VOX:tauko05]
Value=Surrender now and you will live.

[VOX:tauko06]
Value=Hahahaha.

[VOX:tauko07]
Value=That was without honor.

[VOX:tauko08]
Value=You are doomed.

[VOX:tauli01]
Value=I seem to be low on money.

[VOX:tauli02]
Value=The order is given: Attack!

[VOX:tauli03]
Value=Your assistance is required.

[VOX:tauli04]
Value=You must distract our enemies while I make a secret attack.

[VOX:tauli05]
Value=You are beaten! Surrender while you yet have buildings to sell!

[VOX:tauli06]
Value=Hahahaha.

[VOX:tauli07]
Value=What was that? You call that a tactic? You disgust me.

[VOX:tauli08]
Value=Look at the battle, your doom is at hand.

[VOX:tauru01]
Value=My resources are taxed to their limits.

[VOX:tauru02]
Value=I will soon crush our enemies.

[VOX:tauru03]
Value=Send me help comrade, before it is too late!

[VOX:tauru04]
Value=Do something you idiot. I have a plan.

[VOX:tauru05]
Value=If you surrender now, perhaps I will kill you quickly.

[VOX:tauru06]
Value=Hahahaha.

[VOX:tauru07]
Value=You are fool to try such tactics.

[VOX:tauru08]

[COOP:Camp11]
Value=The Soviets have invaded Texas! Stop them.

[COOP:Camp11v]
Value=Commander's Log -Texas, USA: The first Soviet unit to enter the United States was the Russian 2nd Motorized Rifle Division. They quickly set up bases in Southern Texas from which they could strike at US strategic assets all across the Southwest. American forces were quickly overwhelmed and it soon looked as though Russian and Cuban divisions would occupy all major cities in the southern US. Only a few diehard American commanders stood in the way.

[COOP:Camp12]
Value=Soviet and Cuban forces are striking into Alabama. Destroy them.

[COOP:Camp12v]
Value=Commander's Log - Alabama, USA: In the 2nd week of the war, despite massive loses, Soviet and Cuban forces attempted to link their battle lines in Alabama. Though their resources were nearly depleted, American commanders managed to put up a stiff resistance.

[COOP:Camp13]
Value=Cuban forces have invaded Florida. Push them back into the sea.

[COOP:Camp13v]
Value=Commander's Log - Florida, USA: While Russian forces raged across the Old South, Cuban forces quickly invaded Florida. Their first attacks were successful, however the Cubans met with grass-roots resistance when American commanders managed to procure a few MCVs from European blockade-runners.

[COOP:Camp14]
Value=Soviet forces threaten Atlanta. Find and destroy their supply base.

[COOP:Camp14v]
Value=Commander's Log - Georgia, USA: In the 4th week of the war, Russian and Cuban forces gathered in the Georgian countryside. Their mission was simple, gather resources, replenish two badly damaged Soviet divisions and then rage into the undefended city of Atlanta. The Soviet policy was clear, resistance must be punished and the American rebels must be taught a lesson. Before the Soviets were ready, a British spy sent word of the attack to American Commanders and battle was joined.

[COOP:Camp15]
Value=The Soviets have a network of bases along the Mexican border. Destroy them to end the war.

[COOP:Camp15v]
Value=Commander's Log - Texas, USA: As the Soviets were pushed back out of the United States, the last survivors of the battle for Texas laid siege to a mighty Russian battle fortress on the Mexican border. From this base the Soviets could make air and nuclear strikes deep into the United States. The Soviet base had to be destroyed, no matter what the price.

[COOP:Camp21]
Value=Strike a blow for freedom, your forces are in Romania, destroy all Soviet forces.

[COOP:Camp21v]
Value=Commander's Log - Eastern Europe: While the Soviets were striking against America, the Europeans remained silent. When the Soviets nuked Chicago, the Europeans prayed the war would not come to their shores, but when the Soviets attacked Paris, even the most cautious commander knew that the time had come for war. It was a combined French and German force that struck the first blow into Eastern Europe, led by the most aggressive European commanders on the continent.

[COOP:Camp22]
Value=The Soviets have counterattacked into Germany. You must hold the line.

[COOP:Camp22v]
Value=Commander's Log - Eastern Europe: Despite their initial success, the Allies soon found themselves surrounded on all sides by entrenched Soviet forces. Soviet units quickly cut off any chance of retreat in Romania and the Allied expeditionary force was forced to fight their way back to friendly battle lines.

[COOP:Camp23]
Value=You have been ordered to seize control of the Black Sea and her harbors.

[COOP:Camp23v]
Value=Commander's Log - Romania: As weeks stretched into months, the Allies tired as Europe was once again a grim battleground for the most powerful nations on earth. Eager to take the battle to the enemy, the Allies sent their best commanders into the Mediterranean to seize control of vital island strongholds and prepare large fleets for an attack into the Black Sea.

[COOP:Camp24]
Value=In a surprise attack, your forces have been sent into Poland. Crush the unprepared Soviets.

[COOP:Camp24v]
Value=Commander's Log - Poland: With the Soviets distracted by a major amphibious landing on their own shores, Allied forces seized the opportunity to make a major armored attack into Poland. In the 4th month the Allies lead their forces across the Rhine at the dead of night in the middle of winter, taking the Soviet bases completely by surprise.

[COOP:Camp25]
Value=The drive into Russia has begun. Your forces are in the Ukraine and face a desperate Red Army.

[COOP:Camp25v]
Value=Commander's Log - Ukraine, Soviet Union: With most of Europe still weak from battle, two European commanders took it upon themselves to put an end to the war in Europe by striking against the main Soviet Headquarters inside the Russian border. Without authorization or approval from their governments, these commanders gathered what forces remained and struck what they hoped would be a final blow.

[COOP:Camp31]
Value=Destroy all Soviet forces along the Sea of Japan.

[COOP:Camp31v]
Value=Commander's Log - Japan: The Korean government remained neutral during the first few months of the war until a Korean reporter learned that the Soviets had used Psychic Technology to mind control key members of the Korean leadership. When the story broke Korea went to war, and her commanders were to fight in almost every country in the Far East. The first attack took the Soviets almost completely by surprise as the Koreans fought along the coast of Japan for naval supremacy of the Pacific.

[COOP:Camp32]
Value=Defend Vietnam from Soviet aggression.

[COOP:Camp32v]
Value=Commander's Log - Vietnam: As the Soviets continued to spread across South East Asia, consuming the small countries that stood in their way, the Korean Army dispatched two divisions to Vietnam to defend it against a major Soviet strike force. The Korean commanders were outnumbered almost two to one and knew that only superior leadership would save them from certain defeat.

[COOP:Camp33]
Value=Your home nation, Korea is threatened, defend your lands at any cost.

[COOP:Camp33v]
Value=Commander's Log - Republic of Korea: Three weeks after declaring war on the Soviet Union, Korean commanders faced an invasion of their own country by a secret Soviet division hidden from their intelligence network by powerful psychic technology. Using what forces remained in country the Koreans marched to their own border and prepared to make the Soviets pay for every inch of ground.

[COOP:Camp34]
Value=Invade the frozen wastes of eastern Russia and destroy the Soviet bases.

[COOP:Camp34v]
Value=Commander's Log - Harbin, Soviet Union: With most of the Soviet forces in the Far East neutralized or destroyed the Korean High Command ordered their generals to take the fight to the enemy and Korean forces invaded the frozen wastes of Eastern Russia.

[COOP:Camp35]
Value=Complete your invasion of Siberia and destroy the Soviet supply bases that fuel war effort.

[COOP:Camp35v]
Value=Commander's Log - Siberia, Soviet Union: Despite massive losses to battle and the bitter cold, the Korean invasion force was not deterred and moved quickly against the oil fields of eastern Siberia. With the invasion in America going poorly for the Soviets and the European Allies attacking into Russia herself, the Koreans had a unique opportunity to deliver a crippling blow to the Soviet war machine. Korea had a chance to make a huge difference in the overall war.

[COOP:Camp41]
Value=Your legions have invaded Italy. Destroy all who oppose you.

[COOP:Camp41v]
Value=Commander's Log - Italy: While the Russians managed to persuade a few pariah warlord states to join their cause, most were only in the war for their own gain. It was a chance for many warlord nations to prey upon their neighbors, to expand their borders and to seize the resources they needed to maintain their failing economies. While Soviet forces fought around the globe, Iraq and Libya seized the opportunity for a joint invasion of southern Italy. Only a pitiful few French and English forces opposed them.

[COOP:Camp42]
Value=Greece is our next target. Destroy any Allies who dare to oppose our conquest.

[COOP:Camp42v]
Value=Commander's Log - Greece: As the English and French rallied their forces at the Alps the combined forces of the Iraqi and Libyan armies smashed into Greece. The Grecian army was overrun in a matter of days but a combined French and British force brought by boat from India and French Malaysia managed to put up a token resistance.

[COOP:Camp43]
Value=The French and English have counterattacked in Italy. Destroy their advanced bases.

[COOP:Camp43v]
Value=Commander's Log - Italy: Their supply lines overextended and their armies scattered across southern Europe, the Libyans and Iraqis were vulnerable to an Allied counterattack. In the 3rd week of the war the French and English attacked, striking at the ports of southern Italy in an attempt to cut-off Iraqi forces from their naval supply lines.

[COOP:Camp44]
Value=The Allies have paradropped into the fertile plane just outside Baghdad. Destroy them.

[COOP:Camp44v]
Value=Commander's Log - Iraq: After their failed attack, the Allies tried one last desperate gamble in the 4th week of the war. While Libyan death squads hunted down Allied troops in the Italy war-zone, the English and French took what forces they had remaining and made a massive airdrop in the fertile river basin outside of Baghdad, hoping to set up bases to siege the city.

[COOP:Camp45]
Value=The French have built a massive fortress in northern Greece. This is the last point of resistance.

[COOP:Camp45v]
Value=Commander's Log - Greece: Assisted by French base defenses, the Allies built a massive fortress in their last remaining stronghold of northern Greece. The French and English held out for nearly three weeks before the Iraqi and Libyan armies sent in their most battle-hardened commanders to find a way to break through the Allied defenses.

[COOP:Camp51]
Value=Destroy the Russian fleets and naval bases in the North Sea.

[COOP:Camp51v]
Value=Commander's Log - North Sea: While the Soviet army was busy crushing American resistance on the Eastern Seaboard, the Soviet Navy fought a bloody battle to cross the North Atlantic and deliver supplies and reinforcements to their troops. The first battles were fought on tiny islands in the North Sea where combined Allied forces attempted to hold back the Soviet battle groups and destroy any bases the Soviets managed to build.

[COOP:Camp52]
Value=The Soviets have invaded Norway. We must save this ally from Soviet dominion.

[COOP:Camp52v]
Value=Commander's Log - Norway: The initial Allied success prompted an immediate and brutal response from the Soviets. Threatened by superior Allied naval forces, the Soviets invaded the neutral countries of Sweden and Norway to lay claim to the warm water ports that would allow them to build large fleets and strike anywhere along the northern coast of Europe. The Allies gathered their best commanders and with only a handful of forces, sent them into Norway to hold back the Soviet horde.

[COOP:Camp53]
Value=A secret Soviet base has been discovered in the British Isles. Destroy it before it is too late.

[COOP:Camp53v]
Value=Commander's Log - British Isles: As the Soviets became more desperate to deliver war materials to their failing armies in America, they began to try more devious means of breaking the Allied blockade in the North Atlantic. In the 3rd month of the war, a small Soviet force made a secret landing in northern Britain and set up a base. By the time the Allies discovered the Soviet presence, it was nearly too late.

[COOP:Camp54]
Value=The Soviets have swept into Germany. Stop their advance and destroy their forces.

[COOP:Camp54v]
Value=Commander's Log - Germany: As the war entered its 4th month the Allies grew bold and began major attacks into Poland from Austria, striking against Soviet bases and liberating thousands of Polish civilians. The Soviets responded quickly with three armored divisions that swept into eastern Germany, cutting off the Allied attackers. The battle quickly degenerated into a chaotic base versus base duel, with the outcome sure to change the course of the war in Europe.

[COOP:Camp55]
Value=Victory is close at hand, destroy the Soviet naval bases in the Baltic to end the war for the North Atlantic.

[COOP:Camp55v]
Value=Commander's Log - Northern Baltic Sea: Victory after victory had brought the Allies into the Northern Baltic where they hoped to destroy the Soviet naval bases that continually reinforced the Soviet North Atlantic fleet. The Allies were only able to spare a few forces from their blockade groups for the assault, leaving them outnumbered three to one in what they hoped would be the final battle of the North Atlantic campaign.
